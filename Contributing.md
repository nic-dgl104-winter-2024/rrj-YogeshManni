# Contribution to Open-Beta's Open-Taco Project

## Project Name: Open-tacos

----------------------------------------

## About the project

[Open-Tacos](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/tree/develop) is one of the main works done by the [Open Beta](https://github.com/OpenBeta) organization, where a lot of contributors came together to make a platform for rock climbing enthusiasts. It is an open source project and is in its late development stage; some versions of this project have already been published, and the live website can be found at [here](https://openbeta.io/) . The main tech stack of the project is GraphQL, Typescript, React, MongoDB, and Node.js. I am pretty familiar with all the tech used here, and the repository has tens of issues open, which will be good to explore and resolve. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos).

## Fork of the project

## Issues that I will be working on: 

  On the Open-Tacos website, the header part is not aligned with the content; the header is narrower than the rest of the content on the page. This results in multiple distinct widths that users and developers want to avoid. I will be fixing the header width for all the platforms so it can align with the main content. The issue reported can be found at [Content width issue](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/issues/1096).

## Why I decided to work on this issue

  I picked this project because of the tech stack that is being used to develop it. I have built several projects before using React, Node.js. Typescript and GraphQl, so it will be easy to understand the code and work on it. 
  
The issue I will be resolving is related to the frontend of the project, where the width of the header container needs to be fixed so it will align with the content and be flexible enough to match the content on all platforms. I am very familiar with frontend technology and have been working with CSS, HTML, JS, and React for a while now, so I know what approaches can be taken to fix the issue.
