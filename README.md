# Choose a language for community code

&nbsp;

The language I choose to work in is Typescript. Typescript is widely used and is a superset of Javascript. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft as an open-source programming language. I have developed some Web applications using this language and found it extremely useful. It makes logic building process very much easy and we are able to code components in much structured and organized way.
  
Further it go very well with Frontend frameworks such as React and Angular and offers smooth integration with other languages as well. It offers a wide range of inbuilt functions and libraries that makes development way easier and I am looking forward to explore the advance concepts of this language and excited to make some awesome apps.

# Week 9

## Community Code Assignment

  For this assignment I have to choose a repository and contribute to it. Contribution can be writing code, making tutorials, writing or improving documentation or anything that benefits the cause of repository.
  I will be choosing some of the open source repositories that I find interseting and where I can use my skills to resolve the issues. 

---------------------------

## How to contribute to open source

  To get information about how to contribute I read the github article [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#what-it-means-to-contribute). I read through all the ways that they mentioned and found out that
  coding is not the only way to contribute. Some other ways can be - 

  - **Code Contributions**: Fixing bugs, Implemting features and refactoring.
  - **Documentation**: Writing documentation, Translating documentation.
  - **Testing** : Writing tests for the code (Unit testing)
  - **Review and Feedback** : Code reviewing, Issue triaging(Help triage incoming issues, reproduce reported bugs)
  - **Community Engagement** : Answering questions, Organizing Events and Mentoring
  - **Design** : Creating User interface design, User experience (UX) design
  - **Marketing** : Promote the project on social media, blogs or websites or Creating content for project

    Beside all this there are still many other ways to benefit a repository such as financial support, sponsorships etc. For my contribution I will be choosing some open source repositories and will be contributing by writing code to resolve the issues.
    
---------------------------
 ## Repositories to contribute to

   I found some gopod projects from the [Goodfirstissue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/) website. The projects that I am interseted in contributing to are as follows - 

   1) Joplin -

      Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. The tech stack used for development consist of Typescript, electronm, nodejs, javascript and other backend languages.
      The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev). It has some good amount of issues listed that I understand. Below is the completed checklist for this repository -

   2) Open-tacos -     

      Open-tacos is free and open source rock climbing catalog for all the climber enthusiasts. The main tech stack of project is GraphQL, Typescript, React,  MongoDB  and Node.js. I am pretty familiar with all the tech used here and the repository has tens of issues opened which will be good to explore and reolve. Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos). Below is the completed checklist for this repository -

      ![image](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/rrj-YogeshManni/assets/29475936/c229b354-fc6c-4d50-aa55-936e62433793)

  3) PeerTube -

     I have made a app like this with irc client before so I understand the development process, thats the one reason I chose this repository. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/tree/develop).  Below is the completed checklist - 

     ![image](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/rrj-YogeshManni/assets/29475936/723e96c3-50af-4222-88fb-2313d660ad17)

-------------------------

 ## Identify issues to support

   For this activity I have found an issue from open-tacos project that I will be resolving. I found this problem listed in the issues tab in the project's github repository. Issue is as follows - 

   **Issue title - Content width should be consistent from top to bottom of the page**

   **Issue as reported by user -**
   
   In the screenshot below, you can see the header is narrower than the rest of the page, and the banner and the map are full width. So there are three distinct widths to the content.
   At the very least, the header should match the fixed max width of the content.
   The full-width map can be excused as making full use of the space I suppose. Why not do the same with the pictures and use the full width?
   Anyway, it's probably best to have a max width and stick to it. It will make the html/css simpler too.
     
   <img width="1917" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/rrj-YogeshManni/assets/29475936/bcc9a7be-3740-4d96-a7e9-ca77971fe83a">

   I confirmed this issue as well by going to their website at [openbita.io](https://openbeta.io/area/3b281b88-55d1-5857-8b9e-b6c409af601e/puerto-rico).
   The header width is not aligning with the content and I have decided to fix that.

   **Labels associated with Issue are -** 

   - good first issue
   - help wanted

  **Date issue reported** - Feb 13, 2024

  **Link of the issue** - https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/issues/1096

  **How I will contribute to resolve the issue -** 

  I know what's the problem user is facing and its related to HTML and CSS correction. For this project they are using react instead and I'm pretty familiar with that,
  so my approach will be to write suitable media queries with react hooks to align the header with the content at each breakpoint. Another approach will be to use tailwind utility
  classes to resolve the issue as they are using tailwing for styling in the project. Overall, I will be writing some code to fix the issue.

----------------------------

## Contribute to external community

    For this activity I forked the repository of the [open-tacos](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos) project. After that I added CONTRIBUTING.md in my research journal project where I will be documenting the contribution done by me in solving this [issue](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/issues/1096). After downloading the project to my local machine, I compiled it, there were lot of dependencies such as node modules, graphql and lower node version. So I had to fix that. I downgraded my node version and it then I was able to compile it.
