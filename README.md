## Haskell Programming Language

Haskell is a functional programming language renowned for its strong static typing, immutability, and purity. It is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, scientific computing, and financial modeling. Haskell's concise syntax and powerful type system make it an excellent choice for building reliable and scalable software systems.

## What is Haskell Used For?
- **Web Development:** Haskell frameworks like Yesod and Servant are popular choices for building web applications due to their type safety and high-performance characteristics.
- **Data Analysis:** Haskell provides libraries such as Pandoc for parsing and manipulating structured data, making it suitable for data analysis tasks.
- **Scientific Computing:** Haskell's expressiveness and efficiency make it a viable option for scientific computing tasks, such as simulations and numerical computations.
- **Financial Modeling:** Haskell's strong type system and functional paradigm are well-suited for developing robust financial modeling applications used in banking and finance industries.

## Who Uses Haskell?
Several prominent companies and organizations leverage Haskell in their projects, including:
- **Facebook:** Haskell is used in Facebook's spam detection systems and other internal tools.
- **GitHub:** GitHub utilizes Haskell for various backend services and infrastructure components.
- **Standard Chartered Bank:** Haskell is employed in building financial applications for risk management and trading systems.

# User Story

# User Stories for "Hume" by FitTrack, Fitness Tracking App

## Description:
"Hume" is a fitness tracking application designed to help users monitor their physical activity, set fitness goals, track progress, and analyze health metrics. I have it installed on my phone and can track my activity, health metrics and my usual fitness routine thrpugh it.

## User Story 1: Tracking Physical Activity

**As a user, I want to track my daily physical activity, including steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, and active minutes, so I can monitor my overall activity level and progress towards my fitness goals.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
- The app utilizes built-in sensors or integrates with wearable fitness devices to capture and record user activity data.
- Users can view real-time updates of their activity metrics on a dashboard or home screen.
- The app offers options to manually input activity data for activities not captured automatically.
- Users can set daily or weekly activity goals and receive notifications to stay active.
- The app provides insights and analysis of activity trends over time.

## User Story 2: Setting Fitness Goals

**As a user, I want to set personalized fitness goals based on my desired outcomes, such as weight loss, muscle gain, cardiovascular fitness, or overall well-being, so I can track my progress and stay motivated.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
- The app offers a range of predefined fitness goals and targets across different categories.
- Users can customize their fitness goals based on specific parameters.
- The app provides guidance and recommendations for setting realistic goals.
- Users can track their progress towards their goals using visual indicators and progress charts.
- The app offers motivational features such as rewards and challenges.

## User Story 3: Monitoring Health Metrics

**As a user, I want to monitor key health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, sleep quality, and stress levels, so I can assess my overall health and well-being and make informed decisions about my lifestyle and habits.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
- The app integrates with compatible health monitoring devices or sensors to capture user health data.
- Users can view detailed reports and visualizations of their health metrics over time.
- The app provides personalized insights and recommendations based on users' health data.
- Users can set goals for improving specific health metrics.
- The app offers tools for tracking lifestyle factors that may impact health.

## User Story 4: Analyzing Workout Performance

**As a user, I want to analyze my workout performance and metrics such as pace, duration, intensity, and recovery, so I can evaluate the effectiveness of my training sessions and make adjustments to my fitness regimen as needed.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
- The app records detailed workout data for each exercise session.
- Users can view workout summaries and metrics for individual activities.
- The app provides visualizations and graphs of workout performance over time.
- Users can analyze specific aspects of their workout performance to optimize their training plans.
- The app offers tools for planning and scheduling workouts and receiving feedback.

These user stories outline key features and functionalities of the "Hume" fitness tracking app, addressing various aspects of activity tracking, goal setting, health monitoring, and workout analysis.
