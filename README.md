## Haskell Programming Language

Haskell is a functional programming language renowned for its strong static typing, immutability, and purity. It is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, scientific computing, and financial modeling. Haskell's concise syntax and powerful type system make it an excellent choice for building reliable and scalable software systems.

## What is Haskell Used For?
- **Web Development:** Haskell frameworks like Yesod and Servant are popular choices for building web applications due to their type safety and high-performance characteristics.
- **Data Analysis:** Haskell provides libraries such as Pandoc for parsing and manipulating structured data, making it suitable for data analysis tasks.
- **Scientific Computing:** Haskell's expressiveness and efficiency make it a viable option for scientific computing tasks, such as simulations and numerical computations.
- **Financial Modeling:** Haskell's strong type system and functional paradigm are well-suited for developing robust financial modeling applications used in banking and finance industries.

## Who Uses Haskell?
Several prominent companies and organizations leverage Haskell in their projects, including:
- **Facebook:** Haskell is used in Facebook's spam detection systems and other internal tools.
- **GitHub:** GitHub utilizes Haskell for various backend services and infrastructure components.
- **Standard Chartered Bank:** Haskell is employed in building financial applications for risk management and trading systems.
