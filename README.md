## Haskell Programming Language

Haskell is a functional programming language renowned for its strong static typing, immutability, and purity. It is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, scientific computing, and financial modeling. Haskell's concise syntax and powerful type system make it an excellent choice for building reliable and scalable software systems.

## What is Haskell Used For?
- **Web Development:** Haskell frameworks like Yesod and Servant are popular choices for building web applications due to their type safety and high-performance characteristics.
- **Data Analysis:** Haskell provides libraries such as Pandoc for parsing and manipulating structured data, making it suitable for data analysis tasks.
- **Scientific Computing:** Haskell's expressiveness and efficiency make it a viable option for scientific computing tasks, such as simulations and numerical computations.
- **Financial Modeling:** Haskell's strong type system and functional paradigm are well-suited for developing robust financial modeling applications used in banking and finance industries.

## Who Uses Haskell?
Several prominent companies and organizations leverage Haskell in their projects, including:
- **Facebook:** Haskell is used in Facebook's spam detection systems and other internal tools.
- **GitHub:** GitHub utilizes Haskell for various backend services and infrastructure components.
- **Standard Chartered Bank:** Haskell is employed in building financial applications for risk management and trading systems.

## Useful Resources for Learning Haskell

# Choose a language for community code

&nbsp;

The language I choose to work in is Typescript. Typescript is widely used and is a superset of Javascript. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft as an open-source programming language. I have developed some Web applications using this language and found it extremely useful. It makes logic building process very much easy and we are able to code components in much structured and organized way.
  
Further it go very well with Frontend frameworks such as React and Angular and offers smooth integration with other languages as well. It offers a wide range of inbuilt functions and libraries that makes development way easier and I am looking forward to explore the advance concepts of this language and excited to make some awesome apps.

# Week 9

## Community Code Assignment

  For this assignment I have to choose a repository and contribute to it. Contribution can be writing code, making tutorials, writing or improving documentation or anything that benefits the cause of repository.
  I will be choosing some of the open source repositories that I find interseting and where I can use my skills to resolve the issues. 

---------------------------

## How to contribute to open source

  To get information about how to contribute I read the github article [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#what-it-means-to-contribute). I read through all the ways that they mentioned and found out that
  coding is not the only way to contribute. Some other ways can be - 

  - **Code Contributions**: Fixing bugs, Implemting features and refactoring.
  - **Documentation**: Writing documentation, Translating documentation.
  - **Testing** : Writing tests for the code (Unit testing)
  - **Review and Feedback** : Code reviewing, Issue triaging(Help triage incoming issues, reproduce reported bugs)
  - **Community Engagement** : Answering questions, Organizing Events and Mentoring
  - **Design** : Creating User interface design, User experience (UX) design
  - **Marketing** : Promote the project on social media, blogs or websites or Creating content for project

    Beside all this there are still many other ways to benefit a repository such as financial support, sponsorships etc. For my contribution I will be choosing some open source repositories and will be contributing by writing code to resolve the issues.
    
---------------------------
 ## Repositories to contribute to

   I found some gopod projects from the [Goodfirstissue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/) website. The projects that I am interseted in contributing to are as follows - 

   1) Joplin -

      Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. The tech stack used for development consist of Typescript, electronm, nodejs, javascript and other backend languages.
      The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev). It has some good amount of issues listed that I understand. Below is the completed checklist for this repository -
      
      <img width="511" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/rrj-YogeshManni/assets/29475936/aa4bfc56-42f3-41c9-926c-3cca52b47d96">

   2) Open-tacos -     

      Open-tacos is free and open source rock climbing catalog for all the climber enthusiasts. The main tech stack of project is GraphQL, Typescript, React,  MongoDB  and Node.js. I am pretty familiar with all the tech used here and the repository has tens of issues opened which will be good to explore and reolve. Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos). Below is the completed checklist for this repository -

      ![image](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/rrj-YogeshManni/assets/29475936/c229b354-fc6c-4d50-aa55-936e62433793)

  3) PeerTube -
  
     PeerTube is a free, decentralized and federated video platform developed as an alternative to other platforms that centralize our data and attention, such as YouTube, Dailymotion or Vimeo. the tech stack used here is angularjs, IRC client, Typescript and node.js. 
     I have made a app like this with irc client before so I understand the development process, thats the one reason I chose this repository. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/tree/develop).  Below is the completed checklist - 

     ![image](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/rrj-YogeshManni/assets/29475936/723e96c3-50af-4222-88fb-2313d660ad17)

-------------------------

 ## Identify issues to support

   For this activity I have found an issue from open-tacos project that I will be resolving. I found this problem listed in the issues tab in the project's github repository. Issue is as follows - 

   **Issue title - Content width should be consistent from top to bottom of the page**

   **Issue as reported by user -**
   
   In the screenshot below, you can see the header is narrower than the rest of the page, and the banner and the map are full width. So there are three distinct widths to the content.
   At the very least, the header should match the fixed max width of the content.
   The full-width map can be excused as making full use of the space I suppose. Why not do the same with the pictures and use the full width?
   Anyway, it's probably best to have a max width and stick to it. It will make the html/css simpler too.
     
   <img width="1917" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/rrj-YogeshManni/assets/29475936/bcc9a7be-3740-4d96-a7e9-ca77971fe83a">

   I confirmed this issue as well by going to their website at [openbita.io](https://openbeta.io/area/3b281b88-55d1-5857-8b9e-b6c409af601e/puerto-rico).
   The header width is not aligning with the content and I have decided to fix that.

   **Labels associated with Issue are -** 

   - good first issue
   - help wanted

  **Date issue reported** - Feb 13, 2024

  **Link of the issue** - https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/issues/1096

  **How I will contribute to resolve the issue -** 

  I know what's the problem user is facing and its related to HTML and CSS correction. For this project they are using react instead and I'm pretty familiar with that,
  so my approach will be to write suitable media queries with react hooks to align the header with the content at each breakpoint. Another approach will be to use tailwind utility
  classes to resolve the issue as they are using tailwing for styling in the project. Overall, I will be writing some code to fix the issue.

  ------------------------------------------------------------

 # Week 10
  
 ---------------------
 
## Asses external community contributing guidelines

In project's repository there is [Contributing.md](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code_of_conduct.md](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) available where they have explained the guidlines and way to contribute to the [openbeta](https://github.com/openbeta) organization.

The guidelines describes the importance of being respectful and have a friendly nature towards other members. There is explanation of number of ways in which a user can contribute to the projects and proper way to do that. Further the [code of conduct](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) explains the consequences of violating contributing guidlines of the project. There are no hard rules about contributing in this project but they expect good written explanation of the work done and corresponding supporting examples if needed. 

There is Discord chat server available as well which is very friendly and support every user in their ongoing development and any kind of questions they have.

----------------------------

## Contribute to external community

For this activity I forked the repository of the [open-tacos](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos) project. After that I added CONTRIBUTING.md in my research journal project where I will be documenting the contribution done by me in solving this [issue](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/issues/1096). After downloading the project to my local machine, I compiled it, there were lot of dependencies such as node modules, graphql and requirement of lower node version. So I had to fix that. I downgraded my node version and it then I was able to compile it.

--------------------------------

## Compiling open-tacos project

After forking [open-tacos](https://github.com/YogeshManni/open-tacos) repository, I started compiling it. There were lot of errors in start such as node module errors, some dependencies and formatting issues. I read the documentation of project and that was somewhat helpful in fixing some errors, then I installed all the missing modules using following command.
```
npm install
```
Finally the project was compiled and ran using below command.

```
npm run dev
```
*Below is some images of successfull compilation of project.*

# Week 11

-------------------------------

 ## Read through pattern library issues 

   I went through all the issues that were available in the repository and I decided to move along with the implementation of MVC architecture. As I wanted to write code and practice my skills, this issue was best to take over.
   I commented on the issue #14 to get it assigned to myself. Since no one was assigned to this issue, I got it assigned to myself quickly. 
   
   I also saw the pull requests that were opened, although I could have reviewed them  for my work but I wanted to write code by my own and create a small project to implement and explain the MVC principle.
   
   Here is the link of that issue - [MVC architectute](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/issues/14)
     
-----------------------------------


 ## Contribute to Pattern-library

   I started working on assigned issue to implement and expalin MVC architecture. So, I created a fork of pattern-libraray repository. My fork is available [here](https://github.com/YogeshManni/pattern-library/tree/main/patterns/MVC). 
   To demonstrate the MVC principle I decided to code a To-do task list project which will use MERN(Mongodb, Expresss, React and Node.js) stack. 

   Here is how this stack will be used for MVC - 

   - Model - For Model part, Mongodb and Node.js will be used. I will be creating Model for the data that needs to be saved in database.
   - View  - For View part, React will be used. React components will be created to display all the tasks and perform operations at user-end.
   - Controller - For Controller part, Node.js and Express will be used, all the incoming requests will be handled in controller and corresponding response will be sent back to the View after interacting with Model layer.

   Following this strategy I will be coding to-do task list app files to demonstarte MVC architecture.

----------------------------------------
  
 # Week 12


 ## Community Code Project (Part 2) Contributions 
-------------------------------------

  ## Completion of MVC architecture (Contribution in pattern-library)

  After deciding my project structure, I started working on my code to design to-do tasklist project in MVC architecture. As discussed in Week 11 Journal, I created [Modals](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/tree/main/patterns/MVC/models), [Controllers](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/tree/main/patterns/MVC/controllers) and [Views](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/tree/main/patterns/MVC/views) for my project as per MVC principle. The overall project's folder structure is as given below -

  ```
    MVC
    |-- controllers                   # Controllers directory
    |   |-- authentication.js         # Controller for authentication-related requests
    |   |-- category.js               # Controller for category-related requests
    |   |-- server.js                 # Main entry point for backend server
    |   |-- tasks.js                  # Controller for todo task-related requests
    |
    |-- models                        # Models directory
    │   |-- authenticationModel.js    # Model for authentication operations
    │   |-- categoryModel.js          # Model for category operations
    │   |-- tasksModel.js             # Model for todo task operations
    │
    │-- views                          # Views directory
    |   |-- api.js                    # Service for making API requests
    |   |-- App.js                    # Main component for frontend React application
    |   |-- Login.js                  # View component for login page
    |   |-- NewTask.js                # View component for creating a new task
    |   |-- Register.js               # View component for registration page
    |   |-- Todo.js                   # View component for main todo task list page
    |   |-- TodoItem.js               # View component for rendering an individual todo task
    |   │-- TodoList.js               # Component for rendering the list of todo tasks
```
  
  ### Work done to complete this issue - 

  - Added [Controllers](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/tree/main/patterns/MVC/controllers) files (`authentication.js. category.js, server.js and tasks.js`) which serves the purpose of handling requests from client(View) and performing the appropriate operation while interacting with Model and fetching the data from database. After successfull operation, data is sent back to the client.
    
  - Added [Models](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/tree/main/patterns/MVC/models) files (`authenticationModel.js, categoryModel.js, tasksModel.js`).  Models define the data structure of todo tasks and interacts with the database. The Model ensures that data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated in a consistent and reliable manner.
    
  - Added [Views](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/tree/main/patterns/MVC/views) files (`api.js, App.js, Login.js, NewTask.js, Register.js, Todo.js, TodoList.js`) which creates the View part for user to interact with. User can perform various operation on the frontend(View) and corresponding to each operation requests will be sent to controllers to complete that operation.
    
  - Created detailed Readme.md file which explains the MVC architecture workflow using to-do tasklist project. It can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/blob/main/patterns/MVC/README.md).

 ### Other Contributions to pattern-library - 

  - Reviewed React Native implementation for Singleton pattern and gave suggestion to create Singleton class as a separate module(File) to singleton pattern can be properly utilized in react-native. Pull request is available [here](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/pull/78) 
    

----------------------------------------

## Community Code Project (Part 1) Contributions 

  For this part, I solved two issues from [Open-Tacos](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/tree/develop) repository. Those issues are as follows - 

   ---------------------------
   
  ### Issue #1 Content width should be consistent from top to bottom of the page

  On the Open-Tacos website, the header part was not aligned with the content. The header is narrower than the rest of the content on the page. This results in multiple distinct widths that users and developers want to avoid. I will be fixing the header width for all the platforms so it can align with the main content. The issue reported can be found at [Content width issue](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/issues/1096).

  I solved this issue by Writing the code for React components and adding tailwind classes in it. I aligned the content width with other sections that were either narrower then it or broader then it. Only the map section is of full width as requested by user. Detailed summary and explanation of this issue can be found [here](CONTRIBUTING.md#issue-1) in my [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/rrj-YogeshManni/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

  ----------------------------
  
   ### Issue #2 Infinite redirect loop when clicking edit and not logging in

   The issue here was that when a user logout from the website and then if he go to any area or location and try to edit something then the user will stuck in an infinite loop of page reloading (Page keep on loading infinitely). Full issue can be seen [here](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/issues/856)

**Expected behaviour** - The user proposal is to disable the edit button if he's not logged in.

  To solve this issue I fetched user's Session using `useSession` hook from `next-auth` module of React. Then after I got user status i.e if a user is logged in or not, I used conditional operator to change classes of the buttons to disabled it when user is logged out, so the button cannot be clicked and infinite loop situation can be avoided. Detailed summary and explanation of this issue can be found [here](CONTRIBUTING.md#issue-2) in my [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/rrj-YogeshManni/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
